a piece.

Our GUI is very easy-to-use with the clickable GUI, it follows all the 
rules of chess in our classic chess game, and easy to learn for the super 
chess game.

Our chess game meets user's expectation and intuition for a chess game.

Our game does not require any level of literacy and language skills.

### - Perceptible Information
Information in our program is all clear and easy to see.

We provide adequate contrast for selecting the piece and provide valid 
positions to move, and the valid positions show up everytime the user 
select a piece.

In the future, we may implement the preference setting so users can set the 
background to be high-contrast.

contain any potential hazard or adverse consequences.
