So this is the basic structure/vague idea of the project

Entity:                 player.Player, player.Human, player.AI, Piece, piece.ModifiedPiece
Use Case:               board.Board
Controller/Presenter:   BoardManager
Outer most layer:       UI

It's just a framework yet, most of the details are not implemented

We can definitely add more class to it, or separate a class into small pieces

I did not exactly follow the SOLID principle, but I feel this design is solid somehow

Any suggestions and improvements are welcomed!
